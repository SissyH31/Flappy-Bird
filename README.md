# Flappy-Bird

In my program, the coin sometimes appears at weird location, but this situation is very rare

I also add double-players mode and help which are not in my initial report

Moreover, as the game keeps going, the gaps between the up and down pupes become smaller and smaller.

When the bird gets the coin, the score does not add up but the size of the bird would become smaller
